This repository presents the **analysis of an A/B test**, and visually summarizes **departmental growth trends** of a hypothetical **retail store**. 

In part one, **A/B testing**, revenues are compared following different marketing campaign versions sent to **a base of 110,000 customers**.  

In the **departmental growth analysis**, part two, **8,000+ sales transactions** are summarized using different **data visualization** approaches to  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( i ) display the **department ranking** in terms of growth, year-over-year (YoY),  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii&nbsp;) **reveal large-scale shifts in purchasing habits** of subsets of customers, and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) **unveil overall trends across departments**, to be mitigated and to be boosted, **for future growth**.  

The detailed analysis of the A/B testing is presented below, as well as the final visualizations answering to business questions on departmental growth. The SQL codes used in analyzing departmental growth are available in the [repository directory](https://github.com/isis-santos-costa/growth-marketing/tree/main), and the one used in the A/B analysis (v.2.5.1) is available [here](https://github.com/isis-santos-costa/growth-marketing/blob/51b0ab7d7a5aef18f99a279130488e04b6bc50f7/campaign_a_vs_b.sql) and on [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=223570122894:545353684b9a417e91434b62d2a23de2).

<!-- Step 1 -->

## Step 1 ‚Ä¢ Business questions  

There are two parts in this analysis.

Part one is an A/B test aimed at getting insight into the following question and its unfoldings:

> <i> ¬´ Overall, which version of marketing campaign generated better incremental results? ¬ª </i>  
>> <i> ¬´ Did a particular version perform better for a particular set of customers? ¬ª </i>  
>> <i> ¬´ What changes can be made to the campaign in order to improve future results? ¬ª </i>  

Part two, on departmental growth, focuses at answering:

> <i> ¬´ Overall, which Department grew the most, year over year? ¬ª </i>  
> <i> ¬´ Are there any particular groups of customers showing notable shifts in their purchasing habits from year to year? ¬ª </i>  
> <i> ¬´ Based on this data, what marketing efforts or strategies will reinforce positive or mitigate negative trends in future sales growth? ¬ª </i>

<!-- Step 2 -->

## Step 2 ‚Ä¢ Data collection  

The data set for the analysis was exported from a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H8AvUnwQO8APc5vr6cfUISoxNP9Sx38o/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106534574815446903983&rtpof=true&sd=true) into csv files, with table names tidied up into `snake_case`:

![csv-files](https://github.com/isis-santos-costa/growth-marketing/assets/58894233/f7e24458-4fca-40fd-a1af-959a93d4356e)

The files were then loaded into BigQuery following the steps [presented in this repository](https://github.com/isis-santos-costa/kaggle-datasets-in-bigquery):

<!-- Step 3 -->

## Step 3 ‚Ä¢ Data wrangling  

**The A/B test at hand refers to a base of 110,000 customers.** The base was split into two (almost) exact halves, and the customers in each of them received one version of a marketing campaign, A or B.

**Success** of the initiative is measured in terms of the **revenue attributable to the campaing**, defined as the total value of purchases by the customer above what would have happened without the campaing, which is simulated by means of keeping a control group, a set of customers who are not exposed to the campaign.

While the overall split between A and B has targeted the (almost) exact half of customers with each of the marketing campaign versions, data is not evenly splitted for some groups of customers, at the subset level. Thus, in order to enable performance comparisons at the customer subset level, data has to be standardized, with A/B revenues being scaled to emulate a 50/50.

This is performed by multiplying the revenue by a factor calculated as 50 divided by the corresponding percentage of customers receiving that campaign version in the considered subset. For example, supposing in a certain subset **70% of customers were targeted with campaign A** and the other **30% with B**, the revenues would be **scaled to 50/50** as follows:

<p align='center'> 
  $standardized\_revenue_A = (revenue_A) √ó (50/70)$<br>
  $standardized\_revenue_B = (revenue_B) √ó (50/30)$
</p><br>

Standardization was implemented in the SQL code according to the following sequence:  
> (i)   Setting a **parameter** for the tolerance to deviation from 50/50  
> (ii)  Calculating **standardizing factors** for customer subsets with unbalanced split  
> (iii) **Standardizing** substsets of revenues  
> (iv)  Assessing the **winning campaign**, based on standardized revenues  
> (v)   Calculating the **% standardized advantage** of the winning campaign  

<br>

As these calculations are performed multiple times along the query that generates the A/B testing analysis report, they were defined as temporary functions in [BigQuery](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=223570122894:545353684b9a417e91434b62d2a23de2).

-- CTE 6 ‚Ä¢ Results of campaigns A and B | Winning Campaign defined by STANDARDIZED Net Revenue | Compared also by other criteria | Wide Table
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Note on STANDARDIZATION
-- This CTE standardizes to 50/50 results for customer subsets that were unbalanced in the actual experimentation.
-- Unbalanced subsets: segments 'Elite Customers' (75/25), and Infrequent Customers' (25/75)
-- Each subset is large enough, so that the adjustment is performed by assuming random distribution.
-- The unbalanced split are thus scaled to 50/50 ‚Üí  e.g. for A/B = 75/25 ‚Üí Std. Net Revenue A = (Net Revenue / 75 √ó 50)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Affected fields & New fiels
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è MOST IMPORTANT: WINNING CAMPAIGN (as it is a function of an extensive variable)
-- Overall totals of extensive variables are calculated as the sum of STD values for all segments (as -opposed to profiles- segments cover all customers)
-- Extensive variables are adjusted to a standardized version: net revenue, lifted/churned revenue, lifted/churning customer count.
-- Intensive variables (in case, medians) are kept unchanged, as they alone reflect a whole group.

<!-- Step 5 -->

## Step 5 ‚Ä¢ Synthesis  

The A/B testing assessment is summarized in the following image. **Version B** of the marketing campaign is identified as the **overall winning one**, with **version A being successful for some customer profiles**. It stands out that, although A has shown clear advantage in some subsets, it does not happen for segments. A remark is made here: all customers are classified into a segment, not all customers are classified into a profile. Segments are derived from data, based on transaction history. Profiles result from survey, being defined according to cusstomer demography and general traits.

The practical result of the study is a **mapping of A/B preferences at the customer subset level**, as a tool to potencialize future results.

![image](https://github.com/isis-santos-costa/growth-marketing/assets/58894233/71473c11-2dba-4314-8359-f283fd94a7e7)

Regarding **departmental growth**, answer to the first question, on which department grew the most in the period, is presented in the image below. The horizontal axis in the chart was set to logarithmic, in order to emphasize growth, rather than volumes. It can be seen that **'Boots' is the top performer**, in % growth. The colossal value, together with a relative small sales volume in the first year of the period, points out to a presumed recent introduction of the department.

Following it, the **second largest** increase in sales is observed for related department **'Boot Accessories'**.

A **breakdown** of **% growth by department and subset of customers** is presented in the picture below. The noticeable red region blooding into the green growth region on the left of the image indicates a **risk of churning** of the key segments of **'Power Shoppers'** and **'Core Customers'**. Regarding customer profiles, **'City Slickers'**, **'Blue Collar Royalty'** and **'Normal Families'** present an overall concerning trend.

**Shifts in purchasing habits** can be observed from the chart below. The **left region records decreases in sales**, and **tones of gray** were attributed to the departments with most of their sales falling into this region, indicating their **trend towards vanishing**. Departments in this situation are 'Miscellaneous' (Misc), 'Women's Jeans', 'Beachwear', and 'Formalwear'. The colorful bars on the right side of the chart indicate positive sales, compared to the previous year, and reveal a **strong positive trend for the thematic departments** of **'Boots'**, **'Boot Accesssories'**, and **'Cowboys' Hats'**.  

This delivrable presents itself as a **powerful tool** for data-informed decision making, **concisely summarizing critical information** for strategic positioning. It can support, e.g., the definition of a plan to **recover and retain** the 'gray' departments, or to **go all-in** and reinforce with initiatives, campaigns, and visual identity **the observed positive trend for thematic items**.

The entire study is summarized in the presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT2yxVCsu9-GdrpG_4nMwfy12o2fSy7Lo31T8bFn3PI9Ic8AArolBb5uaBdZHwtF8L3aUkPv_ONVJCv/pub?start=true&loop=false&delayms=60000) and in the leaflet below:
